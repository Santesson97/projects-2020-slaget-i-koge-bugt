Here, the consumer will experience an increase in the marginal cost of consumption relative to leisure, for which reason, as can be seen on the panel on the right-hand side, he will increase his demand for leisure while his demand for consumption is stagnant. Consumption will be kept at a level of 1.24, for which a labour income of 0.4 is required given a tax rate of 0.4 and a money endowment of 1. For some interval, the marginal utility from consumption will be ruled out by the marginal utility of leisure, requiring a smaller labour supply when the wage per unit of labour increases. Decreasing the labour supply such that the wage is arbitrarily below 0.4, however, it will be optimal to marginally increase this labour supply until the point where the total wage is excactly 0.4. When the marginal utility from consumption once again equals the marginal utility from leisure, the consumer will gradually begin increasing his labour supply again. \n",

    "Our optimiser suggests that the optimal tax rate is 78.5 %, the additional tax rate for top incomes should be 5.4 %, so that their tax rate increases to 83.9 %, and the cutoff is increased to an income of 0,531. We also note that, even though there are minor differences in the parameters found for the population of 100, 1000 and 10000 citizens, the estimated total tax revenue is the same for all the populations, showing exactly our point that law of large numbers apply in this particular problem. The small differences in the parameters found just suggests that there are different combinations of the paramters which all together maximizes the total tax revenue.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have derived optimal labour supply given wages and tax parameters. Optimal labour supply is increasing in the wage per unit of labour supplied, however, distorting taxes lower the labour supply, which is especially clear when looking at those paying high income taxes. For a politician wishing to maximise the tax revenue, it is possible to increase the tax rates as well as the tax revenue substantially from the initial conditions."
